# SCROLLMAP

An HTML wrapper/lightweight javascript library for creating scrolling storymaps. This library was developed for and used in _Geography 572: Graphic Design in Cartography_ at University of Wisconsin—Madison.

## How to Use

### Basics

Once you install scrollmap.js and scrollmap.css from the Github Repo, and link to them on an HTML page, start by creating a `div` with a class `content`.

```
<div class = "content">
```

To add content to a story, add a `div` class `row`. 

```
<div class = "content">
    <div class = "row">
    </div>
</div>
```

Individual content blocks are `divs` with position classes. For example, the `center` class will create a centered content block on desktop.

```
<div class = "content">
    <div class = "row">
        <div class = "center">
            //insert content here
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

`left` and `right` positioned content `divs` can be placed side-by-side.

```
<div class = "content">
    <div class = "row">
        <div class = "left">
            //left content
        </div>
        <div class = "right">
            //right content
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Sidecar

Basic content classes are easy to easy to use, but they are somewhat limited. A _sidecar_ fixes content to the background, and then scrolls other content atop it. This example uses `img` elements, but any HTML elements can be used. 

Unlike basic content, which uses the `row` class, `sidecar` elements use the `scroll-container` class. Within the `scroll-container` class, a sidecar has a `background-item` div and a `foreground-item` div. 

```
<div class = "content">
    <div class = "scroll-container">
        <div class = "background-item">
            //background items
        </div>
        <div class = "foreground-item">
            //foreground items
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

At its most basic, a `background-item` can simply be an `img`

```
<div class = "background-item">
    <img src="img/background.png">
</div>
```

On the other hand, a `foreground-item` contains any number of basic content blocks.

```
<div class = "foreground-item">
    <div class = "row">
        <div class = "center">
            //insert content here
        </div>
    </div>
 </div>
 ```

 So, the following script would scroll the two foreground items that scroll over a background image.

```
<div class = "content">
    <div class = "scroll-container">
        <div class = "background-item">
            <img src="img/background.png">
        </div>
        <div class = "foreground-item">
            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "center">
                    //insert content here
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "left">
                    //insert content here
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

If, in the previous example, you wanted a new background image to correspond with the second `row` `class` (the `row` that contained a `left` div), you can use the `data-slide` property. `data-slide` links an item in the background to an item in the foreground. 

In the below example, the first `img` in the background appears with the first `div` in the foreground, and the second background `img` appears with the second `div`.

```
<div class = "background-item">
    <img src="img/background.png" data-slide="1">
    <img src="img/background2.png" data-slide="2">
</div>
<div class = "foreground-item">
    <div class = "row">
        <div class = "center">
            //insert content here
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class = "row">
        <div class = "left">
            //insert content here
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

The `data-slide` property essentially allows you have longer sidecars with multiple background and foreground items.

## Documentation

### Content classes

`content`: Class for the highest level div in the document. Required parent class.

`row`: Class for organizing blocks of scrolling content. Required as a parent class for block positioning classes and as a child of the `foreground-item` class.

### Sidecar

Series of upper-level classes to create a sidecar effect, where content scrolls over a fixed background.

`scroll-container`: Parent class for a sidecar div. Requires both a `background-item` and a `foreground-item`.

`background-item`: Child class of `scroll container`, defines content fixed to the background layer.

`foreground-item`: Child class of `scroll container`, defines the "sidecar", or the content that scrolls over the background layer.

### Block Positioning 

Classes for horizontally positioning divs. 

`center`: Position block in center of the window. 

`center-wide`: Position block in the center of the window with no margins on smaller screen sizes.

`left`: Position block on left side of the window.

`right`: Position block on right side of the window.

### Title Class

`title`: Vertically center all child elements of a block to create a title effect. 

### Size Classes

`fit`: Set width to 100% of the parent container. This can be used to constrain the width of images to the width of their parent blocks.

`fill`: Set height to 100% of the parent container. This can be used to set an image to the height of the browser.

### Other Classes

`vert-center`: Vertically center an element within a block. 

`no-margin`: No margin beneath an element. 

`sm-margin`: 25% margin beneath an element. 

`md-margin`: 50% margin beneath an element. 

`lg-margin`: 100% margin beneath an element.
